<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

üìã About The Project
This application provides a hands-on environment to explore financial portfolio theory. It fetches live stock data, applies sophisticated optimization algorithms, and simulates performance against the Nifty 50 benchmark, all while accounting for real-world trading costs.

‚ú® Features
Four Optimization Models: Compare the performance of:

Mean-Variance: The classic Markowitz model.

Risk Parity: Aims for equal risk contribution from each asset.

Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP): A modern, machine-learning-based approach.

Equally Weighted: A simple, yet effective, baseline strategy.

Realistic Cost Simulation: Accurately models initial investment costs, including:

Brokerage Fees

Transaction Taxes (STT)

Execution Slippage

Dynamic Backtesting: Select any historical start date to run a simulation up to the present day.

In-Depth Performance Analysis: Get key metrics like cumulative returns and annualized volatility.

Interactive & Polished UI: Built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.
